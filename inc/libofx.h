/**@file
 * \brief Main header file containing the LibOfx API
 *
 This file should be included for all applications who use this API.  This
 header file will work with both C and C++ programs.  The entire API is 
 made of the following structures and functions. 
 *
 All of the following ofx_proc_* functions are callbacks (Except
 ofx_proc_file which is the entry point).  They must be implemented by 
 your program, but can be left empty if not needed. They are called each
 time the associated structure is filled by the library.
 *
 Important note:  The variables associated with every data element have a 
 *_valid companion.  Always check that data_valid == true before using. 
 Not only will you ensure that the data is meaningfull, but also that
 pointers are valid and strings point to a null terminated string.  
 Elements listed as mandatory are for information purpose only, do not 
 trust the bank not to send you non-conforming data...
